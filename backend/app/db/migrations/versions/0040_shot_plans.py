"""shot plans

PHASE-020. The Shot Planning stage stores each scene's shot skeletons in a new table and runs as
a new job type.

- `shot_plan`: one row per run for one scene, that is, one version of that scene's list of shot
  skeletons. It follows the artifact provenance convention (DATABASE_STRUCTURE.md Section 2.1):
  `source`, `job_id`, `version`, `inputs` and `created_at`, plus `project_id`, the scene's slug
  `scene_id` (the id inside the project's `scene_discovery` content) and the shots themselves
  (`content`). A scene's versions are numbered from 1 (`UNIQUE (project_id, scene_id,
  version)`), and a stored row is never changed. `inputs` records the story hash, the scene
  text's hash, the artifacts the plan was built from (StoryBible, the scene's definition,
  events, speech units and the audio of each unit with its measured length, and the definitions
  of the characters and the environment the scene chose) and the duration rules it was given.
- `job`: its `type` CHECK gains `plan_shots`. `job` is rebuilt (SQLite cannot change a CHECK in
  place), the same way revisions 0028 to 0039 did. No row is changed.

No data needs preserving, so nothing is backfilled.
